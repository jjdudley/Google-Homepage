Used html and css to recreate the Google homepage for TheOdinProject curriculum. Some of the goals for this exercise were:

Know two ways to move a div around on the page
Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
Identify the background color of an existing webpage
Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
Center an element horizontally
Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)

None of the links on this page are functional; It's just supposed to look nice!
